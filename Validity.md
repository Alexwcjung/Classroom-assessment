# 📖 Presentation Summary – Knoch et al. (2020)

## Slide 1 – Research Topic & Need
**Research Topic**
- Study of repeat test takers’ preparation practices for the PTE Academic in Australia  
- Focus: how preparation strategies change across sittings and relate to score gains & test validity  

**Research Need**
- PTE Academic = key requirement for Australian immigration  
- Many candidates retake the test multiple times until target scores are reached  
- Existing research → rich on IELTS/TOEFL, but limited on PTE Academic → study fills this gap  

---

## Slide 2 – Background & Key Concepts
**Test Preparation**
- Activities reviewing test-related knowledge/skills (inside & outside classroom)  
- Becomes critical in high-stakes contexts (e.g., admission, migration)  

**Double-Edged Nature**
- ✅ Positive: builds proficiency, fairer performance  
- ❌ Negative: test-wiseness strategies inflate scores → threaten validity  

**Washback**
- Impact of tests on teaching & learning  
- Preparation practices can lead to positive or negative washback  

---

## Slide 3 – Method
**Research Aims**
- Link between prep activities ↔ score gains  
- Do repeat takers change strategies over time?  

**Design & Participants**
- 60 repeat PTE Academic takers (avg. 6 sittings; 2–22 range)  
- Context: Australia → immigration-driven retakes  

**Data Collection**
- Semi-structured interviews (prep, experience, feedback)  
- Supplement: official score reports  

**Analysis**
- Thematic coding (NVivo)  
- Score gain ≥ 7 points = meaningful improvement  
- Coding framework: Messick (1982) classification

## Slide 4 – Messick’s (1982) Classification

| **Type** | **Description** | **Examples** | **Validity / Washback** |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| **Type 1 (Construct-relevant)** | Builds real language ability | 📖 Reading books/newspapers<br>🗣️ Speaking in English<br>📝 Writing essays with feedback | ✅ Positive washback<br>✅ Strengthens validity |
| **Type 2 (Test familiarization & practice)** | Reduces anxiety, builds test familiarity | ⏱️ Learning test format<br>📝 Mock tests<br>🎤 PTE “Describe image” practice | ⚖️ Neutral<br>Limited language growth |
| **Type 3 (Test-wiseness)** | Gaming the scoring system | 🎙️ Speaking unnaturally fast/loud<br>📑 Memorizing sample answers<br>🎯 Guessing strategies | ❌ Negative washback<br>❌ Threatens validity |

## Slide 5 – Results: Score Improvements
**Improvement Categories**
- Medium: +7–9 points  
- Large: +10 or more  
- Gradual: ≥ +10 over multiple sittings (no decline)  

**Skill-specific Findings**
- **Speaking** → largest gains  
  - Type 3 (fluency tricks, voice modulation)  
  - Type 2 (task practice)  
- **Reading** → gradual gains (Type 1: general reading, aloud practice)  
- **Listening** → modest gains (dictation-focused practice)  
- **Writing** → minimal gains (isolated practice, mock tests)  

---

## Slide 6 – Discussion & Implications
**RQ1 – Prep & Score Gains**
- Speaking gains → often Type 3 strategies (validity risk)  
- Reading/Listening/Writing → gains from Type 1 activities  

**RQ2 – Strategy Changes**
- Early sittings: little prep → Type 2 (familiarization)  
- Later shifts: Type 3 (gaming) or Type 1 (language learning)  
- Paths = strategic but non-linear  

**Implications**
- Positive washback often delayed  
- PTE Speaking vulnerable to construct-irrelevant prep  
- Test developers should encourage Type 1 prep  

---

## Slide 7 – Teacher Discussion Questions
- Should teachers spend more time on **test-taking strategies** (timing, guessing, task practice) or on **general English ability** (reading, speaking, writing)?  
- How can we maintain a **balance** between the two?  
- Given that repeat test takers often shift from shortcuts to genuine learning, how can teachers **accelerate this shift** toward construct-relevant skills?
