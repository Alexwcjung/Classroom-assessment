**Fairness of Using Different English Accents: The Effect of Shared L1s in Listening Tasks of the Duolingo English Test**  
*Language Testing, Vol. 41(2), 263–289*

---

## 🧭 Introduction

- International English proficiency tests have long faced **validity and fairness issues** regarding the use of *nonstandard English accents*.  
- Tests such as TOEFL and IELTS often **privilege standard English**, disadvantaging *non-native speakers*.  
- With the rise of **Global Englishes (GEs)**, researchers now emphasize reflecting *diverse English accents* in listening assessment.  
- This study explored **Duolingo English Test (DET)** listening tasks — *yes/no vocabulary* and *dictation* — to examine:  
  1. The effect of accent variability on listening performance  
  2. The influence of **shared first language (L1)** between speaker and listener  
  3. The impact of **task type** on performance  

### 🎯 Research Questions
1. To what extent does listening to *shared vs. different English accents* affect test-takers’ DET listening performance?  
2. How do *different English accents* influence performance across the two DET task types (*yes/no vocabulary* and *dictation*)?

## 📚 Literature Review

### 1️⃣ Use of Different English Accents in Listening Assessment
- **Kachru’s (1985)** *World Englishes (WE)* model divides English varieties into:
  - **Inner circle (내부권, 미·영 등 표준 원어민):** Standard native English (U.S., U.K.)
  - **Outer circle (외부권, 공용어로 사용되는 인도, 필리핀 등):** Official but not everyday English (India, Philippines)
  - **Expanding circle (확장권, 외국어로 배우는 국가, 한국·중국 등):** Foreign language contexts (Korea, China)
- Recent stuudies call for including *L1-accented English varieties* in testing (Harding, 2012)
  - However, because of concerns about **accent familiarity** and the risk of **listening bias**,  test developers have generally preferred to **maintain standard accents** (Taylor & Geranpayeh, 2011). 
- **Shared-L1 Intelligibility Benefit** (Bent & Bradlow, 2003): 
  - Shared phonological systems lead to higher comprehension between speakers and listeners with the same L1.  
  - Yet, effects may disappear for **highly intelligible or advanced speakers** (Kang et al., 2019; Munro et al., 2006).  

### 2️⃣ Task Types and Listening Assessment
- Listening tasks such as dictation and yes/no tests rely largely on speaker intelligibility rather than purely on listening skills (Kang et al., 2018, 2020).
- Studies show that when speakers are highly intelligible, outer- and expanding-circle accents do not significantly reduce comprehension (Field, 2013; Kang et al., 2019, 2020).
- Therefore, further research is needed to examine how global English accents affect the validity of listening tasks in assessments like the Duolingo English Test (DET) (Dai & Roever, 2019).

## ⚙️ Method

| **Section** | **Key Details** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Participants** | - **Speakers:** 24 total across **six English varieties** (American, British, Chinese, Indian, Korean, Mexican English). Expert raters evaluated each speaker’s **accentedness** and **comprehensibility** on a 5-point scale, selecting those averaging **4 or higher**. **Intelligibility** was measured via **word transcription accuracy**, and only speakers scoring **90% or higher** were included. <br> - **Listeners:** 160 participants (40 each from Chinese, Korean, Hindi, and Spanish L1 groups). Mean age **23.8 years**, with an average of **6.5 years of English study**. |
| **Tasks** | - **Yes/No Vocabulary Task:** Each phase contained **18 items** (9 real words + 9 nonwords). Participants heard nine stimuli per screen and judged whether each was a real English word (e.g., *“planet” → Yes*, *“flenip” → No*). They could listen **unlimited times within 90 seconds**. Recordings were evenly distributed across four speakers (at least two per speaker). <br><br> - **Dictation Task:** Each phase included **8 sentences** (two per speaker). Participants listened and **transcribed each sentence accurately** (e.g., *“The boy is reading a book.”*). Each item could be played **up to three times**, and participants had **60 seconds** to type the transcription. Items were randomly selected from each accent pool but kept **identical across listeners** to avoid repetition across phases. <br><br> - **Elicited Imitation Test (EIT):** Comprised of **24 sentences** used as an **independent measure of overall English proficiency**. Participants listened to a sentence, **identified one of two target words**, and **repeated the sentence as accurately as possible** (e.g., *Heard: “The professor explained the theory.” → Choices: theory / story → Correct: theory*). Sentences were organized into **three blocks** by length and linguistic complexity, with a fixed block order but **randomized items within each block**. |
| **Procedure** | Three listening phases: (1) **Standard accent** (AmE/BrE) → (2) **Shared L1 accent** → (3) **Unfamiliar non-shared accent**. Each phase used **unique, non-repeated items** presented in **random order**, and the task interface **mirrored the Duolingo English Test (DET)**. Total duration was approximately **45 minutes**. |
| **Analysis** | Data were analyzed using a **Linear Mixed-Effects Model (LMM)** to examine the effects of **accent** and **task type** on listening performance. |

## 📊 Results

### 🌳 Shared vs. Different Accent Effects

| Predictor | β | p | Interpretation |
|------------|---|---|----------------|
| **Shared-L1 accent** | +0.016 | .044 | 공유된 억양에서 유의한 향상 |
| **Inner-circle accent** | +0.019 | .416 | 표준 억양과 차이 없음 |
| **Outer-circle (Indian)** | −0.041 | .035 | 인도 억양에서는 수행 저하 |
| **Task effect** | n.s. | .708 | 과제 유형 차이 없음 |

- **Korean listeners** outperformed all other groups (β = .079, *p* < .001).  
- **Shared-L1 accents > other L2 accents**, but **Shared-L1 ≈ Inner-circle** when both were highly intelligible.  

### 🌱 Task Type Effects
- Dictation vs. Yes/No 과제 간 유의한 차이 없음 (p = .708).
- 두 과제 모두 음운 인식 기반으로, 화자의 명료도가 주요 영향 요인임.

## 💬 Discussion

1. **Shared-L1 Benefit:**  
   Listeners performed better when hearing speakers who shared their L1, confirming Bent & Bradlow (2003)’s *Matched Interlanguage Intelligibility Benefit*.  

2. **Inner-circle vs. Shared-L1:**  
   Performances were equally high — possibly due to **familiarity** with standard accents through learning exposure.  

3. **Indian (Outer-circle) Accent:**  
   Despite high intelligibility, produced lower scores — suggesting accent familiarity still matters.  

4. **Task Type:**  
   No task-specific effects; both rely on similar **phonemic-level processing** and working memory.  

5. **Pedagogical & Testing Implications:**  
   - Including **highly intelligible non-native accents** can improve fairness and ecological validity.  
   - Potential for test-takers to **choose accent options** (e.g., Inner-circle or Shared-L1).  

6. **Limitations:**  
   - Only one *outer-circle* variety (Indian English).  
   - Speaker selection limited (24 out of 77 met intelligibility threshold).  
   - Korean group may have benefited from **task-type familiarity**.
