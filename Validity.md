# Research Topic & Need
Research Topic
• Study of repeat test takers’ preparation practices for the PTE Academic in Australia
• Focus: how preparation strategies change across sittings and relate to score gains & test validity
Research Need
• PTE Academic = key requirement for Australian immigration
• Many candidates retake the test multiple times until target scores are reached
• Existing research → rich on IELTS/TOEFL, but limited on PTE Academic → study fills this gap


📖 Slide 2 – Background & Key Concepts
Test Preparation
• Activities reviewing test-related knowledge/skills (inside & outside classroom)
• Becomes critical in high-stakes contexts (e.g., admission, migration)
Double-Edged Nature
• ✅ Positive: builds proficiency, fairer performance
• ❌ Negative: test-wiseness strategies inflate scores → threaten validity
Washback
• Impact of tests on teaching & learning
• Preparation practices can lead to positive or negative washback

📖 Slide – Method (Knoch et al., 2020)
Research Aims
• Link between prep activities ↔ score gains
• Do repeat takers change strategies over time?
Design
• Participants: 60 repeat PTE Academic takers (avg. 6 sittings, 2–22 range)
• Rationale: Feedback enables longitudinal tracking
Data Collection
• Semi-structured interviews (prep, experience, feedback)
• Supplement: official score reports
Analysis
• Thematic coding (NVivo)
• “Meaningful improvement” = ≥ 7 points
• Focus: activity types, strategy shifts, prep–score links



좋습니다 👍 지금까지 정리한 Method–Results–Discussion을 PPT 발표용 슬라이드 구조로 종합해드릴게요. Messick(1982) 분류는 Method 안에서 “분석 코딩 체계”로 표와 함께 설명을 넣었습니다.


📝 Slide 1 – Method (Knoch et al., 2020)
Research Aims
• Link between prep activities ↔ score gains
• Do repeat takers change strategies over time?
Design & Participants
• 60 repeat PTE Academic takers (avg. 6 sittings; 2–22 range)
• Context: Australia → immigration-driven retakes
Data Collection
• Semi-structured interviews (prep, experience, feedback)
• Supplement: official score reports
Analysis
• Thematic coding (NVivo)
• Score gain ≥ 7 points = meaningful improvement
• Coding framework: Messick (1982) classification


📊 Slide 2 – Messick’s (1982) Classification

Type
Description
Examples
Validity / Washback
Type 1(Construct-relevant)
Builds real language ability
📖 Reading books/newspapers🗣️ Speaking in English📝 Writing essays w/ feedback
✅ Positive washback✅ Strengthens validity
Type 2(Test familiarization & practice)
Reduces anxiety, builds test familiarity
⏱️ Learning test format📝 Mock tests🎤 PTE “Describe image” practice
⚖️ NeutralLimited language growth
Type 3(Test-wiseness)
Gaming the scoring system
🎙️ Speaking unnaturally fast/loud📑 Memorizing sample answers🎯 Guessing strategies
❌ Negative washback❌ Threatens validity



📈 Slide 3 – Results: Score Improvements
Improvement Categories
• Medium: +7–9 points
• Large: +10 or more
• Gradual: ≥ +10 over multiple sittings (no decline)
Skill-specific Findings
• Speaking → largest gains
• Type 3 (fluency tricks, voice modulation)
• Type 2 (task practice)
Reading → gradual gains
• Type 1 (general reading, aloud practice)
Listening → modest gains
• Dictation-focused practice
Writing → minimal gains
• Isolated practice, mock tests


💬 Slide 4 – Discussion & Implications
RQ1 – Prep & Score Gains
• Speaking gains → often Type 3 strategies (validity risk)
• Reading/Listening/Writing → gains from Type 1 activities
RQ2 – Strategy Changes
• Early sittings: little prep → Type 2 (familiarization)
• Later shifts: Type 3 (gaming) or Type 1 (language learning)
• Paths = strategic but non-linear
Implications
• Positive washback often delayed
• PTE Speaking vulnerable to construct-irrelevant prep
• Test developers should encourage Type 1 prep



Should teachers spend more time on test-taking strategies (timing, guessing, task practice) or on general English ability (reading, speaking, writing)?
How can we maintain a balance between the two?
Given that repeat test takers often shift from test-focused strategies to genuine language learning, how can teachers design instruction that accelerates this shift toward construct-relevant skills?
