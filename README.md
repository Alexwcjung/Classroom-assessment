## Introduction 
“Given the limited amount of class time that can be used exclusively for vocabulary in EFL classroom settings such as South Korea, it is necessary to use effective methods that can increase opportunities for English exposure and vocabulary learning at the same time.”

“Glosses are useful because they work as both aids for English comprehension and tools for vocabulary learning simultaneously when learners read a text (Hulstijn, Hollander, & Greidanus, 1996; Ko, 2005).”

“However, glosses used in previous studies were static in terms of presenting meanings and explanations for glossed words. In other words, learners passively received the given definition without any further assistance regarding identifying the meaning independently.”

“In order to compensate for this passive nature, glossing can be designed by drawing on Dynamic Assessment (DA), a framework that integrates assessment with instruction.”

“Meanwhile, different challenges have been reported when implementing DA in the classroom setting. As Davin (2013) stated, ‘This form of DA administration in dyads is time-consuming, limiting the number of participants with whom a mediator can work’ (p. 307).”

“In response to these issues, the present study introduced the concept of Chatbot-Assisted Dynamic Assessment (CA-DA) as a form of glossing in which a chatbot acted as a mediator regarding unfamiliar words when learners read a text.”

“During CA-DA, learners engaged in more open-ended dialogues with chatbots and gained opportunities to recognize and produce unfamiliar words by receiving automated mediation while not constrained to a multiple-choice format.”

----------
Research Questions:
1. “Is CA-DA effective for receptive and productive vocabulary learning in L2 learners?”
2. “How can CA-DA be used for diagnosing L2 learners’ vocabulary knowledge?”

## Literature Review 
   
“Glossing refers to providing definitions of unknown words in reading passages… it can facilitate reading comprehension and incidental vocabulary learning, but simple glosses may lead to shallow processing.”
→ 글로싱은 단어 이해와 어휘 학습을 돕지만, 피상적 처리 한계가 있음.

“Dynamic Assessment (DA) integrates assessment and instruction through mediation, revealing learners’ Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). Unlike static tests, DA examines not only what learners know but also how much support they need.”
→ DA는 교수+평가를 결합하여 학습자의 ZPD를 드러냄. 기존 정적 평가는 못 보는 ‘지원 필요 수준’을 알 수 있음.

“Computer-mediated DA can deliver individualized scaffolding at scale. Learners can receive graduated prompts ranging from implicit hints to explicit feedback.”
→ 컴퓨터 기반 DA는 점진적 힌트 제공으로 개별 맞춤형 교수 가능.

“Chatbots, as conversational agents, are promising mediators because they can provide immediate, interactive, and adaptive support during reading.”
→ 챗봇은 즉각적이고 상호작용적이며 적응적인 중재 가능성 제시.

## Method
1. Participants
   - Initial pool: 81 Korean 6th-grade EFL learners (age 12)
   - Screening: A vocabulary size test was administered. Only learners within the 1,200–1,500 word range were selected to ensure homogeneity.
   - Final sample: 53 learners met the criteria.
   - Proficiency: ACTFL Novice level; none had overseas experience.
   - Grouping:
     1. CA-DA (n=18): chatbot + graduated prompts
     2. CA-NDA (n=18): chatbot + simple glosses
     3. Control (n=17): no chatbot support

2. Target Vocabulary & Materials
   - 10 words: blizzard, demon, jar, jewelry, kernel, moisture, pot, refrigerator, sand, torch
   - Source: The Popcorn Book (de Paola, 1978), simplified passages (~200–220 words)
   - Target words underlined for focus

3. Procedure
   - Pretest → two treatment sessions → Immediate Posttest → Delayed Posttest (2 weeks)
   - Treatment sessions:
        - Length: 25 min × 2 days
        - Task: read passages & infer meaning of underlined words
   - Group tasks:
        - CA-DA: dynamic chatbot scaffolding (graduated hints)
        - CA-NDA: chatbot provides only definitions
        - Control: reading only

4. Chatbot Design
   - Platform: Google Dialogflow (tablet-based)
   - Mode: text-based interaction (Korean & English)
   - Prompt hierarchy (CA-DA only):
      1.	“Read the sentence again and guess.”
      2.	Highlight context clues
      3.	Provide guiding question
      4.	Give new example sentence

5. Measures
   - Receptive test: write definition (L1 or L2) for target words
   - Productive test: write English word for pictures (with first letter + blanks)
   - Scoring:
      - Receptive & Productive: 1 point per item (max 10 each)
   - Reliability: interrater = 98%; Cronbach’s α ≥ 0.70

## Results 
#### 🌳 Receptive Vocabulary Knowledge

1. Descriptive Statistics
   
   | Group   | Posttest M (SD) | Delayed M (SD) |
   |---------|-----------------|----------------|
   | CA-DA   | 7.94 (1.95)     | 7.17 (2.23)    |
   | CA-NDA  | 5.89 (1.78)     | 5.06 (1.43)    |
   | Control | 1.88 (1.11)     | 1.41 (1.00)    |

➡️ 평균 점수 차이: CA-DA > CA-NDA > Control

2. Inferential Statistics
   - “In the posttest and delayed posttest, the statistical results were F(2, 50) = 59.696, p < .05, η² = 0.70 and F(2, 50) = 54.425, p < .05, η² = 0.69, respectively.”

#### 🌳 Productive Vocabulary Knowledg

1. Descriptive Statistics
   
   | Group   | Posttest M (SD) | Delayed M (SD) |
   |---------|-----------------|----------------|
   | CA-DA   | 6.33 (2.30)     | 4.56 (1.79)    |
   | CA-NDA  | 4.28 (1.96)     | 3.17 (1.86)    |
   | Control | 2.06 (1.34)     | 1.41 (1.12)    |

➡️ 평균 점수 차이: CA-DA > CA-NDA > Control

2. Inferential Statistics
   - “Regarding productive vocabulary knowledge … F(2, 50) = 21.640, p < .05, η² = 0.46 … F(2, 50) = 16.277, p < .05, η² = 0.39.”
➡️ 두 검사 모두 CA-DA 집단이 가장 우수, 효과 크기도 큼.

3. Diagnostic Insights (CA-DA group only)
 3.1. Descriptive Statistics (Session별 점수)
  - Session 1 → Actual M=1.11 (SD=2.14), Mediated M=15.78 (SD=5.46)
  - Session 2 → Actual M=8.61 (SD=5.89), Mediated M=28.89 (SD=8.73)
➡️ 시간이 지날수록 Actual & Mediated 점수 모두 상승

3.2. 추론통계 
   - “Increases in the mean actual and mediated scores from session 1 to session 2 revealed that learners in the CA-DA group improved in terms of both independent and mediated performance.”
➡️ 학습자들이 점차 더 적은 힌트로 정답 도출 → 자기조절(self-regulation) 발달의 증거.

------------
최종 요약
•	기술통계: M, SD로 집단별 성취 수준 확인 → CA-DA > CA-NDA > Control
•	추론통계: ANOVA 결과, 모든 차이가 p < .05에서 유의미, 효과 크기 큼 (η² 0.39~0.70)
•	추가 진단: CA-DA 집단 학습자들의 Actual vs Mediated 점수 상승 → 학습 + 평가 동시 가능


## Discussion
1. CA-DA most effective → higher scores than CA-NDA & Control (both receptive & productive)
2. Retention confirmed → effects sustained in delayed posttests
3. Diagnostic value → prompt levels revealed learners’ ZPD & individual differences
4. Pedagogical implication → chatbot-assisted DA supports both learning & assessment
5. Limitations → small sample, limited to elementary learners & 10 words → need broader studies
