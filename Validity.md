# Presentation Summary – Knoch et al. (2020)

## 🌳 Research Topic & Need
**Research Topic**
- Study of Self-Access Test-Takers’ Preparation Practices for PTE Academic in Australia
- Focus: how preparation strategies change across sittings and relate to score gains & test validity  

**Research Need**
- PTE Academic = key requirement for Australian immigration  
- Many candidates retake the test multiple times until target scores are reached  
- Existing research → rich on IELTS/TOEFL, but limited on PTE Academic → study fills this gap

## 🌳 Background & Key Concepts  

### Test Preparation  
- Activities reviewing test-related knowledge/skills (inside & outside classroom)  
- Becomes critical in **high-stakes contexts** (e.g., admission, migration)  
- Categorized into three types (Messick’s Classification, 1982):  

---

#### 🔹 Type 1: Construct-relevant practice  
- Description: Builds construct-relevant skills; directly improves the language abilities the test is designed to measure  
- Examples: Reading books/newspapers, speaking in English, writing essays with feedback  
- Validity / Washback: ✅ Positive washback, strengthens validity  

#### 🔹 Type 2: Test familiarization & practice  
- Description: Reduces construct-irrelevant interferences by familiarizing candidates with test format, tasks, and procedures  
- Examples: Learning test format, taking mock tests, practicing tasks such as “describe an image”  
- Validity / Washback: ⚖️ Neutral effect, helps fairness but limited language growth  

#### 🔹 Type 3: Test-wiseness strategies  
- Description: Relies on construct-irrelevant skills; exploits test design or scoring algorithms rather than language ability  
- Examples: Speaking unnaturally fast or loud, memorizing sample answers, using guessing strategies  
- Validity / Washback: ❌ Negative washback, threatens validity  

---

### Double-Edged Nature  
- ✅ Positive: builds proficiency, fairer performance  
- ❌ Negative: test-wiseness strategies inflate scores and threaten validity  

---

### Washback  
- Impact of tests on teaching & learning  
- Preparation practices can lead to both positive and negative washback

## 🌳 Method
**Research Aims**
- Link between prep activities ↔ score gains  
- Do repeat takers change strategies over time?  

**Design & Participants**
- 60 repeat PTE Academic takers (avg. 6 sittings; 2–22 range)  
- Context: Australia → immigration-driven retakes  

**Data Collection**
- Semi-structured interviews (prep, experience, feedback)  
- Supplement: official score reports  

**Analysis**
- Thematic coding (NVivo)  
- Score gain ≥ 7 points = meaningful improvement  
- Coding framework: Messick (1982) classification  

---

## 🌳 Results: Score Improvements
**Improvement Categories**
- Medium: +7–9 points  
- Large: +10 or more  
- Gradual: ≥ +10 over multiple sittings (no decline)  

**Skill-specific Findings**
- **Speaking** → largest gains  
  - Type 3 (fluency tricks, voice modulation)  
  - Type 2 (task practice)  
- **Reading** → gradual gains (Type 1: general reading, aloud practice)  
- **Listening** → modest gains (dictation-focused practice)  
- **Writing** → minimal gains (isolated practice, mock tests)  

---

## 🌳 Discussion & Implications
**RQ1 – Prep & Score Gains**
- Speaking gains → often Type 3 strategies (validity risk)  
- Reading/Listening/Writing → gains from Type 1 activities  

**RQ2 – Strategy Changes**
- Early sittings: little prep → Type 2 (familiarization)  
- Later shifts: Type 3 (gaming) or Type 1 (language learning)  
- Paths = strategic but non-linear  

**Implications**
- Positive washback often delayed  
- PTE Speaking vulnerable to construct-irrelevant prep  
- Test developers should encourage Type 1 prep  

---

## 🌳 Teacher Discussion Questions
- Should teachers spend more time on **test-taking strategies** (timing, guessing, task practice) or on **general English ability** (reading, speaking, writing)? and how can we maintain a **balance** between the two?  
- Given that repeat test takers often shift from shortcuts to genuine learning, how can teachers **accelerate this shift** toward construct-relevant skills?
