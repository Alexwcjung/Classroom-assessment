## 🌳 Research Topic & Need  

**Research Topic**  
- Study of self-access test takers’ preparation practices for the **PTE Academic** in Australia  
- Focus: how preparation strategies change across sittings and relate to **score gains & test validity**  

**Research Need**  
- PTE Academic = key requirement for **Australian immigration**  
- Many candidates **retake the test multiple times** until target scores are reached  
- Existing research → extensive on **IELTS/TOEFL**, but limited on **PTE Academic** → this study fills the gap

## 🌳 Background & Key Concepts  

**Test Preparation**  
- Activities reviewing test-related knowledge/skills (inside & outside classroom)  
- Critical in **high-stakes contexts** (e.g., admission, migration)  
- Categorized into three types (Messick’s Classification, 1982):  

**🔹 Type 1: Construct-relevant practice**  
- Description: Builds construct-relevant skills; directly improves the language abilities the test measures  
- Examples: Reading books/newspapers, speaking in English, writing essays with feedback  
- Validity / Washback: ✅ Positive washback, strengthens validity  

**🔹 Type 2: Test familiarization & practice**  
- Description: Reduces construct-irrelevant interferences by familiarizing candidates with test format, tasks, and procedures  
- Examples: Learning test format, taking mock tests, practicing tasks such as *describe an image*  
- Validity / Washback: ⚖️ Neutral effect, helps fairness but limited language growth  

**🔹 Type 3: Test-wiseness strategies**  
- Description: Relies on construct-irrelevant skills; exploits test design or scoring algorithms rather than language ability  
- Examples: Speaking unnaturally fast or loud, memorizing sample answers, using guessing strategies  
- Validity / Washback: ❌ Negative washback, threatens validity  

**Double-Edged Nature**  
- ✅ Positive: builds proficiency, fairer performance  
- ❌ Negative: test-wiseness strategies inflate scores and threaten validity  

**Washback**  
- Impact of tests on teaching & learning  
- Preparation practices can lead to **positive or negative washback**

## 🌳 Method  

**Research Aims**  
- Link between preparation activities ↔ score gains  
- Do repeat takers change strategies over time?  

**Design & Participants**  
- 60 repeat PTE Academic takers 
- Context: Australia → immigration-driven retakes  

**Data Collection**  
- Semi-structured **phone interviews** (audio-recorded, avg. 33 minutes)  
- Focus on **test preparation, test-taking experiences, and score feedback**  
- Supplement: official score reports  

**Analysis**  
- Interviews transcribed and coded thematically using **NVivo**  
- Score gain ≥ **7 points** = meaningful improvement  
- Coding framework: **Messick (1982) classification**  

---

## 🌳 Results: Score Improvements  

**Improvement Categories**  
- Medium: +7–9 points  
- Large: +10 or more  
- Gradual: ≥ +10 over multiple sittings (no decline)  

**Skill-specific Findings**  
- **Speaking** → largest gains  
  - Type 3 (fluency tricks, voice modulation)  
  - Type 2 (task practice)  
- **Reading** → gradual gains (Type 1: general reading, aloud practice)  
- **Listening** → modest gains (dictation-focused practice)  
- **Writing** → minimal gains (isolated practice, mock tests)  

---

## 🌳 Discussion & Implications  

**RQ1 – Prep & Score Gains**  
- Speaking gains → often **Type 3 strategies** (validity risk)  
- Reading/Listening/Writing → gains from **Type 1 activities**  

**RQ2 – Strategy Changes**  
- Early sittings: little prep → Type 2 (familiarization)  
- Later shifts: Type 3 (gaming) or Type 1 (language learning)  
- Paths = **strategic but non-linear**  

**Implications**  
- Positive washback often **delayed**  
- PTE Speaking vulnerable to **construct-irrelevant prep**  
- Test developers should **encourage Type 1 preparation**

## 🌳 Teacher Discussion Questions  

1. Should teachers spend more time on **test-taking strategies** (timing, guessing, task practice) or on **general English ability** (reading, speaking, writing)?  
   - How can we maintain a **balance** between the two?  

2. Given that repeat test takers often shift from shortcuts to genuine learning, how can teachers **accelerate this shift** toward construct-relevant skills?
