# **Exploring the Potential of  Conversational AI for Assessing Second  Language Oral Proficiency**  

---

# 🌳 Research Topic & Need

## **Research Topic**
This study examines whether a conversational AI–based Spoken Dialogue System (SDS) can:
- elicit **Interactional Competence (IC)** from L2 speakers, and  
- provide an **authentic and effective** speaking test experience.

## **Research Need**
- **IC (interactional competence)** is a core part of oral proficiency but is not assessed in most large-scale computer-based English tests.  
- Tests like **TOEFL, Versant, Duolingo** are largely monologic → **cannot assess IC**.  
- Human examiner interviews are **costly**, **inconsistent**, and affected by **interlocutor idiosyncrasies**.  
- SDS has potential to combine **standardization + interactiveness**.

## **Research Questions (Official RQs in the Paper)**

**RQ1:** *What types of interactive language functions are elicited by the SDS, and how frequently do these functions appear in test-taker responses?*

**RQ2:** *What are test takers’ perceptions of the SDS-mediated speaking test in terms of authenticity and effectiveness?*

# 🌳 Background: Interactional Competence (IC)

IC refers to the ability to co-construct real-time conversation.  
Key components include:

- managing turn-taking  
- repairing misunderstandings and overlaps  
- opening and closing conversations  
- maintaining alignment through politeness  
- adjusting speech based on the interlocutor’s status and shared knowledge  
- providing backchannels (e.g., *yeah, right, wow* + facial expressions, eye contact, head nods)  
- managing topics  
- behaving in accordance with one's social role  

→ Essential in real communication but often **not measured** in computer-based tests.

# 🌳 Method

## **Participants**
- 30 adult L2 English learners  
- 10 joined follow-up interviews  
- All performances rated by two trained human raters (IELTS scale)

## Procedure
1. **SDS가 IELTS Speaking 시험관(examiner) 역할을 수행**  
   - 학습자는 사람 대신 AI와 face-to-face 처럼 대화. AI가 질문하고, 이어서 자연스럽게 follow-up 질문을 던지는 구조   
2. Learners engage in real-time interaction with SDS.  
3. 모든 대화는 녹음 및 전사(transcription)됨  
4. 인간 평가자가 녹음본을 듣고 채점  
5. Researchers analyze:
   - IC features and frequency  
   - Learner perceptions (authenticity, comfort, difficulty)  

## Data Sources  

- **Interaction transcripts** → IC 요소(turn-taking, clarification 등) 코딩  
- **Human rating scores** → 평가자 일치도 분석  
- **Post-test interviews** → 자연스러움·난이도·편안함 등 피드백  
- **IC coding scheme** → established IC research 기반  
→ *정성(대화 분석) + 정량(평가자 점수) 혼합의 mixed-methods 연구*

# 🌳 Results

## **RQ1 — IC features elicited by SDS**
### ✔ Summary
SDS successfully elicited **core IC features**, and these behaviors helped **distinguish proficiency levels**.  

### **1) Turn-taking**
- All learners engaged in **normal, reciprocal turn-taking** with SDS.  
- Higher-proficiency speakers often produced **longer turns (약 20–30% 더 길게)** or brief expansions.  
  - *“I think one challenge… and another thing is…”*

### **2) Clarification & Repair**
- Learners used clarification requests:
  - *“Sorry, could you repeat that?”*  
- Higher-level learners showed more natural **self-repair**:
  - *“I think… I mean, the main reason is…”*

### **3) Topic Management**
- Learners maintained SDS-initiated topics effectively.  
- Advanced learners expanded topics:
  - *“Another important point is…”*

### RQ1 Conclusion
- SDS-generated interactions formed **valid, assessable samples**.

## **RQ2 — Test-Taker Perceptions of SDS**

### ✔ Summary
Learners generally evaluated SDS as **competent and reliable**, but noted a lack of **human-like naturalness**.

### Positive Perceptions
- **Competent and consistent**: SDS asked clear, predictable questions.  
- **Reduced anxiety**: Learners felt less pressure than with human examiners.  
- **Enjoyment**: Some learners found the AI interaction fun and comfortable.

### Negative Perceptions
- **Lack of naturalness**: No nonverbal cues such as eye contact or facial expressions.  
- **Occasional interruptions**: Sudden topic shifts or unnatural timing.  
- **Preference for humans**: Learners still favored human interviewers for richer, more natural interaction.

### RQ2 Conclusion
- Learners viewed the SDS as efficient and low-stress, but its limited naturalness led many to still prefer human interlocutors.

# 🌳 Implications
- SDS can supplement or partially replace human examiners in speaking assessments.    
- Valid sample 제공 + 높은 표준화  
- 개선 필요: multimodal cues (표정·시선·제스처), 정확한 인식, 더 자연스러운 대화 흐름  
- 교육·평가 분야에서 AI 활용 가능성 증가

1. SDS를 활용한 교실 말하기 활동은 어떤 것이 있을까?
2. AI SDS가 인간 시험관을 완전히 대체할 수 있을까?
