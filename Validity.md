# 📖 Drawing on repeat test takers to study test preparation practices and their links to score gains – Knoch et al. (2020)

---

## 🌳 Research Topic & Need  

**Research Topic**  
- Study of self-access test takers’ preparation practices for the **Pearson Test of English(PTE) Academic** in Australia  
- Focus: how preparation strategies change across sittings and relate to **score gains & test validity**  

**Research Need**  
- PTE Academic = key requirement for **Australian immigration**  
- Many candidates **retake the test multiple times** until target scores are reached  
- Existing research → extensive on **IELTS/TOEFL**, but limited on **PTE Academic** → this study fills the gap  

**Research Questions**  

- RQ1: Are the test preparation activities reported by candidates related to actual score improvements?  
- RQ2: Do repeat test takers change their preparation strategies over successive sittings?

## 🌳 Background & Key Concepts  

**Test Preparation (Messick, 1982)**  

**🔹 Type 1: Construct-relevant practice**  
- Focus: Building **real language ability** the test is designed to measure  
- Examples: Reading books/newspapers, speaking in English, writing essays with feedback  
- Validity/Washback: ✅ Positive → strengthens validity, fosters genuine proficiency  

**🔹 Type 2: Test familiarization & practice**  
- Focus: Reducing **unfamiliarity with test tasks** or **test anxiety**  
- Examples: Learning test format, **practice tests (mock exams)**, rehearsing task types (e.g., *describe an image*)  
- Validity/Washback: ⚖️ Neutral → fairer performance but limited language growth  

**🔹 Type 3: Test-wiseness strategies**  
- Focus: Exploiting **construct-irrelevant features** of test design or scoring algorithms  
- Examples: Speaking unnaturally fast/loud, memorizing templates, using guessing tricks  
- Validity/Washback: ❌ Negative → threatens validity, inflates scores without ability gains  

**Double-Edged Nature**  
- ✅ Positive: builds proficiency, fairer performance  
- ❌ Negative: test-wiseness strategies inflate scores and threaten validity  

**Washback**  
- Tests impact **teaching & learning**  
- Preparation practices → **positive or negative washback**

## 🌳 Method  

**Research Aims**  
- Link between preparation activities ↔ score gains  
- Do repeat takers change strategies over time?  

**Design & Participants**  
- 60 repeat PTE Academic takers  
- Test sittings: **min 2, max 22, avg. 6**  

**Data Collection**  
- Semi-structured **phone interviews** (audio-recorded, avg. 33 minutes)  
- Focus: **test preparation, test-taking experiences, score feedback**  

**Analysis**  
- Interviews transcribed and coded thematically using **NVivo**  
- Score gain ≥ **7 points** = meaningful improvement  
- Coding framework: **Messick (1982) classification**

## 🌳 Results: Score Improvements  

**Skill-specific Findings**  
- **Speaking** → largest gains  
  - Type 3 (test-wiseness: fluency tricks, voice modulation)  
  - Type 2 (task-specific practice)  
- **Reading** → gradual gains (Type 1: general reading, aloud practice)  
- **Listening** → modest gains (dictation-focused practice)  
- **Writing** → minimal gains (isolated practice, mock exams)  

---

## 🌳 Discussion & Implications  

**RQ1 – Prep & Score Gains**  
- Speaking gains → often from **construct-irrelevant test-wiseness strategies** (validity risk)  
- Reading/Listening/Writing → gains mainly from **construct-relevant activities**  

**RQ2 – Strategy Changes**  
- Early sittings: little prep → Type 2 (familiarization)  
- Later: shift to **Type 3 (test-wiseness)** or **Type 1 (construct-relevant learning)**  
- Paths = **adaptive but non-linear**  

**Implications**  
- Positive washback often **delayed**  
- PTE Speaking vulnerable to **construct-irrelevant preparation**  
- Test developers should **promote construct-relevant strategies (Type 1)**

## 🌳 Teacher Discussion Questions  

1. Should teachers focus more on **test-taking strategies** (timing, guessing, task drills) or on **general English ability** (reading, speaking, writing)?  
   - How can we maintain a **balance** between the two?  

2. Since repeat takers often shift from test-wiseness strategies to genuine language learning, how can teachers **accelerate this shift** toward construct-relevant skills?
